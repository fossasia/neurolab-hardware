# Hangman

## Playing the Game
Start by pressing the play button. You may select one of five categories. Afterwards, you may select the letters on screen to attempt to guess the right consonants that are in the word. After either winning or losing, you may choose to play again by selecting a new category. You may even choose to add more words to challenge your friends by clicking the button next to the category selection.

## Code
To keep it organized and flexible, the code is based on two main objects: letters and word. The letters object deals with the management of the letters you select. The word object deals with the processing of the word including choosing the word and displaying the letters of the word on screen. The canvas is drawn by the canvas object, and its method is called every time the number of guesses left drops.
