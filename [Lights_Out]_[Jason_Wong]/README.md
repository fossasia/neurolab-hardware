# Lights Out

## Using It
Flick on and off the lights by selecting the light you want to control and hitting the switches. Each flick of the switch toggles the light.

## Code
The game is purely based on HTML, CSS, and JS, so there are absolutely no images except for the background. The code is also very modular, so you can add a light or lightswitch by copying the HTML lightswitch element and instantiating it in JS.
